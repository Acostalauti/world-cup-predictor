For backend, use uv for dependency management. A few useful commands are:

uv sync
uv add <PACKAGE-NAME>
uv run python <PYTHON-FILE>

Regularly commit code to git 

Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
